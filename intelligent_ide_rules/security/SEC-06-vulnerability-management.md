# Rule SEC-06: Vulnerability Management & Patch SLAs

## 🛡 **Summary**
Actively manage discovered vulnerabilities and enforce patch timelines based on severity through automated scanning, tracking, and remediation workflows.

## 🔍 **Problem Statement**
Delaying patching of critical vulnerabilities leads to compromise. Automated tools must surface issues and enforce SLAs to maintain security posture and prevent exploitation.

## ✅ **Standard Requirements**

### **MANDATORY Vulnerability Management**
- **All dependencies scanned weekly (e.g., Snyk, Trivy)**
- **Critical vulns patched in <7 days**
- **High vulns patched in <30 days**
- **Medium vulns tracked in backlog**

### **SLA Matrix**
```yaml
# Vulnerability SLA Configuration
vulnerability_slas:
  critical:
    cvss_score: "9.0-10.0"
    patch_time: "7 days"
    escalation: "Security team + Management"
  high:
    cvss_score: "7.0-8.9"
    patch_time: "30 days"
    escalation: "Security team"
  medium:
    cvss_score: "4.0-6.9"
    patch_time: "90 days"
    escalation: "Development team"
```

## 🧪 **Implementation Guidance**

### **Automated Scanning**
- Integrate Trivy into CI pipelines
- Use Dependabot or Renovate for dependency PRs
- Monitor CVSS scores, prioritize runtime risk
- Implement vulnerability database synchronization

### **Dependency Management**
```yaml
# Dependabot configuration
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    reviewers:
      - "security-team"
    assignees:
      - "dev-team"
```

## 📈 **Success Metrics**
- ✅ **100% repos scanned**
- ✅ **<5% open critical vulns >7 days**
- ✅ **SLA breach rate <2%**

## 🧩 **Related Tools**
- **Trivy**: Container and dependency scanning
- **Snyk**: Vulnerability management platform
- **Dependabot/Renovate**: Automated dependency updates

## 🏛 **Compliance Mapping**

| Framework | Control ID | Coverage |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **NIST SSDF** | RV.2.1 | ✅ Full |
| **ISO 27001** | A.12.6.1 | ✅ Full |
| **SOC 2** | CC7.1 | ✅ Full |
