# Rule SEC-10: Threat Modeling & Risk Reviews

## üõ° **Summary**
Proactively identify security threats and misconfigurations before deployment through structured threat modeling and comprehensive risk assessment processes.

## üîç **Problem Statement**
Without structured threat modeling, architectural flaws go undetected until exploitation, leading to costly security incidents and compromised systems.

## ‚úÖ **Standard Requirements**

### **MANDATORY Threat Modeling Process**
- **Threat models MUST be created for critical services**
- **Reviews MUST include STRIDE/MAESTRO categories**
- **Mitigations MUST be linked to implementation tickets**
- **Models MUST be updated quarterly or after major changes**

### **STRIDE Threat Categories**
```yaml
# STRIDE Threat Model Framework
threat_categories:
  spoofing:
    description: "Impersonating users or systems"
    mitigations: ["strong_authentication", "certificate_validation"]
  tampering:
    description: "Unauthorized modification of data"
    mitigations: ["data_integrity_checks", "secure_channels"]
  repudiation:
    description: "Denying actions performed"
    mitigations: ["audit_logging", "digital_signatures"]
  information_disclosure:
    description: "Exposing sensitive information"
    mitigations: ["encryption", "access_controls"]
  denial_of_service:
    description: "Disrupting system availability"
    mitigations: ["rate_limiting", "resource_quotas"]
  elevation_of_privilege:
    description: "Gaining unauthorized access levels"
    mitigations: ["least_privilege", "privilege_separation"]
```

## üß™ **Implementation Guidance**

### **Threat Modeling Process**
- Use threat modeling templates (MS Threat Model, OWASP)
- Track risks in backlog with mitigations assigned
- Review models quarterly or after major changes
- Integrate threat modeling into design reviews

### **Risk Assessment Matrix**
```yaml
# Risk Scoring Framework
risk_matrix:
  likelihood:
    low: 1      # Rare occurrence
    medium: 2   # Possible occurrence
    high: 3     # Likely occurrence
  impact:
    low: 1      # Minor impact
    medium: 2   # Moderate impact
    high: 3     # Severe impact
  risk_levels:
    "1-2": "Low Risk"
    "3-4": "Medium Risk"
    "6-9": "High Risk"
```

### **Threat Model Template**
```markdown
# Threat Model: [Service Name]

## System Overview
- **Purpose**: Brief description of service functionality
- **Data Flow**: Diagram showing data movement
- **Trust Boundaries**: Identified security boundaries

## Assets & Attack Surface
- **Critical Assets**: Data, services, infrastructure
- **Entry Points**: APIs, user interfaces, integrations
- **Trust Levels**: User roles and permissions

## Threats Identified (STRIDE)
| Threat | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|------|------------|
| [Description] | [STRIDE] | [L/M/H] | [L/M/H] | [Score] | [Action] |

## Mitigation Plan
- [ ] High priority mitigations (Risk ‚â• 6)
- [ ] Medium priority mitigations (Risk 3-4)
- [ ] Monitoring and detection improvements
```

## üìà **Success Metrics**
- ‚úÖ **100% critical services modeled**
- ‚úÖ **100% mitigations tracked to closure**
- ‚úÖ **0 missed threat categories per review**
- ‚úÖ **<7 days average time from threat ID to mitigation plan**
- ‚úÖ **100% of high-risk findings remediated within 30 days**

## üß© **Related Tools**
- **OWASP Threat Dragon**: Visual threat modeling tool
- **CloudProvider Threat Modeling Tool**: Structured analysis framework
- **Manual STRIDE matrix**: Systematic threat identification

## üèõ **Compliance Mapping**

| Framework | Control ID | Coverage |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **NIST SSDF** | PO.3.1 | ‚úÖ Full |
| **ISO 27001** | A.18.2.1 | ‚úÖ Full |
| **SOC 2** | CC7.3 | ‚úÖ Full |

## üìã **Implementation Checklist**
- [ ] Train security and development teams on threat modeling
- [ ] Create threat model templates for different service types
- [ ] Establish threat modeling review process
- [ ] Integrate threat modeling into SDLC
- [ ] Set up tracking system for identified threats
- [ ] Define escalation procedures for high-risk findings

This rule establishes systematic threat identification and risk assessment to proactively address security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
