# Rule SEC-15: Continuous Compliance & Audit

## üõ° **Summary**
Automatically track and enforce controls across systems through continuous monitoring and evidence collection to maintain real-time compliance posture.

## üîç **Problem Statement**
Manual audits are slow and error-prone. Continuous monitoring ensures real-time enforcement and provides automated evidence collection for compliance frameworks.

## ‚úÖ **Standard Requirements**

### **MANDATORY Continuous Compliance Controls**
- **Controls MUST be testable and code-defined**
- **Policies MUST be checked continuously in CI/CD**
- **Evidence collection MUST be automated for each rule**
- **Non-compliance MUST trigger immediate remediation**

### **Compliance Automation Framework**
```yaml
# Continuous Compliance Architecture
compliance_framework:
  policy_engines:
    - open_policy_agent
    - kyverno
    - conftest
  evidence_collection:
    - automated_screenshots
    - configuration_snapshots
    - audit_log_exports
  reporting:
    frequency: "daily"
    formats: ["json", "csv", "pdf"]
    recipients: ["security_team", "compliance_officer"]
```

## üß™ **Implementation Guidance**

### **Policy as Code Implementation**
- Use OPA/Kyverno + custom CI gates
- Export evidence to GRC platform (e.g., Drata, Tugboat)
- Report non-compliance daily
- Implement automated remediation where possible

### **OPA Policy Examples**
```rego
# Kubernetes Security Policy
package kubernetes.security

deny[msg] {
  input.kind == "Pod"
  input.spec.containers[_].securityContext.runAsRoot == true
  msg := "Containers must not run as root"
}

deny[msg] {
  input.kind == "Deployment"
  not input.spec.template.spec.containers[_].resources.limits.memory
  msg := "All containers must have memory limits defined"
}

# Network Policy Requirement
deny[msg] {
  input.kind == "Namespace"
  not has_network_policy(input.metadata.name)
  msg := "All namespaces must have default deny network policy"
}
```

### **Compliance Evidence Collection**
```yaml
# Evidence Collection Configuration
evidence_collection:
  infrastructure_scans:
    - tool: "checkov"
      schedule: "daily"
      scope: ["terraform", "kubernetes", "dockerfile"]
    - tool: "kube-bench"
      schedule: "weekly"
      scope: ["kubernetes_cis"]
  
  configuration_monitoring:
    - resource_type: "aws_s3_bucket"
      compliance_check: "encryption_enabled"
      evidence_type: "api_response"
    - resource_type: "kubernetes_pod"
      compliance_check: "security_context"
      evidence_type: "manifest_snapshot"
  
  access_reviews:
    frequency: "monthly"
    scope: ["iam_roles", "kubernetes_rbac", "database_users"]
    evidence: ["access_matrix", "approval_logs"]
```

### **Automated Remediation**
```yaml
# Auto-Remediation Rules
remediation_rules:
  high_priority:
    - violation: "unencrypted_storage"
      action: "enable_encryption"
      approval_required: false
    - violation: "exposed_admin_interface"
      action: "restrict_access"
      approval_required: false
  
  medium_priority:
    - violation: "missing_backup"
      action: "create_ticket"
      assignee: "infrastructure_team"
    - violation: "outdated_certificate"
      action: "schedule_renewal"
      notification: "security_team"
```

## üìà **Success Metrics**
- ‚úÖ **100% controls mapped to rules**
- ‚úÖ **100% rule results logged daily**
- ‚úÖ **0 non-testable rules**
- ‚úÖ **<4 hours time to remediation for critical findings**
- ‚úÖ **95% automated evidence collection coverage**

## üß© **Related Tools**
- **Open Policy Agent**: Policy engine for compliance as code
- **Kyverno**: Kubernetes-native policy management
- **Drata/Tugboat Logic**: GRC platforms for compliance automation

## üèõ **Compliance Mapping**

|-----------|------------|----------|
| **NIST SSDF** | RV.3.5 | ‚úÖ Full |
| **ISO 27001** | A.18.2.3 | ‚úÖ Full |
| **SOC 2** | CC7.4 | ‚úÖ Full |

## üìã **Implementation Checklist**
- [ ] Deploy policy engines (OPA/Kyverno) in CI/CD
- [ ] Define all compliance controls as code
- [ ] Set up automated evidence collection
- [ ] Integrate with GRC platform for reporting
- [ ] Configure automated remediation for critical findings
- [ ] Train teams on compliance as code practices

This rule establishes continuous compliance monitoring and automated evidence collection to maintain real-time compliance posture and reduce manual audit overhead.
