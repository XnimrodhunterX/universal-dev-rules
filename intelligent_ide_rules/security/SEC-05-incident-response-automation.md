# Rule SEC-05: Incident Response & IR Automation

## üõ° **Summary**
Define and automate clear procedures for handling security incidents with comprehensive playbooks, automated alerting, and streamlined response workflows.

## üîç **Problem Statement**
Delayed response to security events can escalate into data breaches. Incident processes must be documented, tested, and automated to ensure rapid and effective response to security threats.

## ‚úÖ **Standard Requirements**

### **MANDATORY Incident Response Framework**
- **IR playbooks MUST be defined for common scenarios**
- **Alerts MUST be routed to responders via Slack/PagerDuty**
- **Postmortems MUST be written within 3 business days**
- **Audit trail of incidents MUST be retained for 1 year**

### **Incident Classification**
```yaml
# Incident Severity Matrix
severity_levels:
  critical:
    description: "Data breach or system compromise"
    response_time: "15 minutes"
    escalation: "C-level executives"
  high:
    description: "Service disruption or security vulnerability"
    response_time: "1 hour"
    escalation: "Security team lead"
  medium:
    description: "Potential security issue"
    response_time: "4 hours"
    escalation: "On-call engineer"
```

## üß™ **Implementation Guidance**

### **Automated Response Workflows**
- Use GitHub Security Advisories, Jira workflows
- Use pre-defined runbooks and automation scripts
- Integrate with PagerDuty/OpsGenie for alert routing
- Implement ChatOps for incident coordination

### **Response Automation**
```yaml
# PagerDuty Integration
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: incident-config
data:
  pagerduty_key: "{{ .Values.pagerduty.integration_key }}"
  slack_webhook: "{{ .Values.slack.webhook_url }}"
  escalation_policy: "security-team"
```

## üìà **Success Metrics**
- ‚úÖ **IR playbooks in every critical service**
- ‚úÖ **Incident response < 15 min median**
- ‚úÖ **100% postmortems completed within SLA**

## üß© **Related Tools**
- **PagerDuty**: Incident alerting and escalation
- **Jira/GitHub Issues**: Incident tracking
- **Slack API/OpsGenie**: Communication and coordination

## üèõ **Compliance Mapping**

| Framework | Control ID | Coverage |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **NIST SSDF** | RV.3.3 | ‚úÖ Full |
| **ISO 27001** | A.16.1.5 | ‚úÖ Full |
| **SOC 2** | CC7.2 | ‚úÖ Full |
