# Universal Development Rules - Documentation Standards

Apply these documentation practices in all development work:

## Code Documentation
- Write clear, concise comments explaining WHY, not what
- Use JSDoc, PyDoc, or equivalent for function/method documentation
- Include examples in complex function documentation
- Keep README files up-to-date with setup and usage instructions

## API Documentation
- Use OpenAPI 3.0+ specifications for all APIs
- Include request/response examples
- Document error responses with proper status codes
- Provide authentication and authorization details

## Architecture Documentation
- Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant decisions
- Maintain system architecture diagrams (C4 model recommended)
- Document data flow and integration patterns
- Include deployment and infrastructure documentation

## Technical Writing Standards
- Use clear, active voice
- Structure content with proper headings and hierarchy
- Include code examples that are tested and working
- Provide troubleshooting sections for common issues

## Documentation Maintenance
- Review and update documentation with each feature release
- Use automated tools to check for broken links
- Include documentation updates in code review process
- Archive outdated documentation rather than leaving it stale

## Team Knowledge Sharing
- Document team decisions and processes
- Create onboarding guides for new team members
- Maintain runbooks for operational procedures
- Share lessons learned through post-mortems
