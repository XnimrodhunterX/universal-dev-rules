# Universal Development Rules - Security Standards

Apply these security practices in all code development:

## Credential Hygiene
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to version control
- Use environment variables or external secret management systems
- Implement secret rotation and expiration policies
- Apply least-privilege access principles

## Input Validation & Sanitization
- Validate all user inputs at API boundaries
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS vulnerabilities
- Implement rate limiting and request throttling

## Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0, OIDC)
- Implement proper session management
- Apply role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration

## Security Scanning
- Integrate SAST tools in CI/CD pipelines
- Perform dependency vulnerability scanning
- Implement container security scanning
- Apply infrastructure security scanning

## Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper data classification
- Apply data residency and privacy regulations
- Use secure communication protocols (TLS 1.3+)
