# Universal Development Rules - Project Management

Apply these project management practices consistently:

## Planning & Estimation
- Break down work into small, manageable tasks (< 8 hours)
- Use story points or time-based estimation consistently
- Include technical debt and refactoring in sprint planning
- Define clear acceptance criteria for all tasks

## Version Control & Branching
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Follow consistent branch naming: feature/task-description, bugfix/issue-description
- Write meaningful commit messages with context
- Use conventional commits format when possible

## Issue & Task Management
- Create detailed issue descriptions with context and requirements
- Use labels/tags for categorization (bug, feature, technical-debt, etc.)
- Link related issues and pull requests
- Update status regularly and communicate blockers early

## Code Review Process
- Require peer review for all code changes
- Review for functionality, security, performance, and maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback with specific suggestions
- Approve only when you would be comfortable maintaining the code

## Communication & Collaboration
- Use asynchronous communication as default (issues, PRs, documentation)
- Schedule regular stand-ups or check-ins for complex projects
- Document decisions and share context with the team
- Escalate blockers and dependencies promptly

## Quality & Delivery
- Define "Definition of Done" for all work
- Include testing, documentation, and deployment in task completion
- Use continuous integration and automated quality checks
- Plan for rollback and monitoring of changes

## Risk Management
- Identify and document technical risks early
- Have contingency plans for critical dependencies
- Monitor project health through metrics (velocity, cycle time, etc.)
- Conduct regular retrospectives and act on feedback
