# Universal Development Rules - Core Architecture

Apply these architectural principles consistently across all development:

## API-First Design
- Design APIs before implementation using OpenAPI 3.0+ specifications
- Follow RFC 9457 for structured error responses
- Implement consistent pagination, filtering, and sorting patterns
- Use semantic versioning for API contracts

## Health & Observability
- Implement standardized health endpoints: `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs and trace context
- Apply OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- Include performance budgets and SLO monitoring

## Resilience Patterns
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
- Use exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Apply bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
- Design for graceful degradation under load

## Security-First
- Apply zero-trust architecture principles
- Use least-privilege access controls
- Implement defense-in-depth strategies
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs
