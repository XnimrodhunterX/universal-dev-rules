# Universal Development Rules - Database Operations

When working with databases, apply these standards:

## Schema Design
- Use consistent naming conventions (snake_case for PostgreSQL, camelCase for MongoDB)
- Implement proper indexing strategies for query performance
- Apply database normalization principles (3NF minimum)
- Include audit fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)

## Migration Management
- Use version-controlled database migrations
- Implement reversible migrations where possible
- Test migrations on production-like data volumes
- Apply zero-downtime migration strategies

## Query Optimization
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement query performance monitoring
- Apply proper connection pooling
- Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads

## Data Integrity
- Implement proper foreign key constraints
- Use database-level validation where appropriate
- Apply transactional boundaries correctly
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

## Security & Compliance
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement row-level security where needed
- Apply principle of least privilege for database access
- Use database audit logging for compliance

## Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query execution times and plans
- Track database connection metrics
- Implement alerting for performance degradation
- Use database-specific monitoring tools
