# Universal Development Rules - Frontend Components

When building frontend components, apply these standards:

## Component Architecture
- Use composition over inheritance for component design
- Implement single responsibility principle for components
- Apply consistent prop interfaces and naming conventions
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience

## State Management
- Use local component state for component-specific data
- Apply centralized state management (Redux, Zustand, Pinia) for shared state
- Implement proper state normalization patterns
- Use immutable update patterns for state changes

## Performance Optimization
- Implement proper component memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Use code splitting and lazy loading for large components
- Apply virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking

## Accessibility & UX
- Implement proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Use proper color contrast ratios
- Provide loading states and error boundaries

## Testing Strategies
- Write unit tests for component logic
- Implement integration tests for component interactions
- Use visual regression testing for UI consistency
- Apply accessibility testing tools

## Styling & Theming
- Use consistent design system and component libraries
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Apply CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for component isolation
- Use design tokens for consistent theming
